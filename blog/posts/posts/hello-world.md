The blog is now live at `/blog`! It renders a markdown file using [Remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-html) and styles it using [`tailwindcss/typography`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin). This blog 📕 is a fork of the [Next.js Blog](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter). This blog is still in ⚙️ Beta, So expect 🐞 bugs! You can report them in my [github repo](https://github.com/aramshiva/website)'s issues tabs.

It has styling like

```
code
```

or `inline code` and **bold** text or

## Titles

_or even italic text_.

Blog posts will be coming soon, for now. Let me fix some bugs 👷.

Sincerely,

Aram Shiva
