Welcome to my website! This website took alot of seeing other's cool websites, changin stuff (were on v10!). I'm going to go through some pages of this site:

### /index

This was the most complex one, but after a while I decided instead of an over the top portfolio, why not just a message. A message to the reader, to the internet.

### /guestbook

This one was complex, for this one I use [Vercel KV Redis](https://vercel.com/storage/kv), KV was a nice choice as I dont need the extra features of something like SQL.

### /photos

This ones simple but fun, if you diddn't know I am in to [photography](https://www.aram.sh/uses#:~:text=Photography). This page gets my images from my [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/191297914@N06/) and uses a nice parallax scroll effect to display them.

### /blog

This one was complex. This blog is a heavily edited version of the [Vercel Next.js Blog](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter).

## Inspiration
