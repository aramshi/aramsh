## aram.sh

this is my new website! I used to have an [overly](https://github.com/aramshiva/website/tree/v10) [complex](https://github.com/aramshiva/website/tree/v9.1) website, but now it's just a simple markdown file. 

### Site Development
It runs using [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and [React](https://react.dev/)

To run locally follow these steps:
- Clone the repository locally
- Create a `.env.local` file based on [`.example.env`](https://github.com/aramshiva/website/blob/dev/.example.env)
- Run `bun install`
- Run `bun run dev` to get a local copy working.
