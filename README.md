[![CodeQL](https://github.com/aramshiva/website/actions/workflows/github-code-scanning/codeql/badge.svg)](https://github.com/aramshiva/website/actions/workflows/github-code-scanning/codeql)

Welcome! This is my corner of the internet. It is published on [aram.sh](https://aram.sh) and [aramshiva.com](https://aramshiva.com).

## Stack
This site is using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as the web framework (built off of [React](https://react.dev/)). It uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for the file format, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for CSS, and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for Linting. It is being deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

## Contributing
Any contributions are helpful! To contribute, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Please make sure you have the following tools installed to help contribute
- [ ] A package manager ([`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) is a good one)!
- [ ] [`npx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx)
- [ ] Knowledge of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)/[React](https://react.dev/)
- [ ] (Optional) A code editor. ([Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my recommendation!)


### Contribute
Now, the good stuff!

* Install all necessary packages by running ```yarn``` in the terminal. (Make sure to have some space on your disk; this may be big.)
* Setup the development server by running ```yarn dev``` or ```npx next dev``` in your terminal app of choice.
A message like 
``` ‚ñ≤ Next.js 14.0.4 - Local: http://localhost:3000 ...``` will appear.
* Go to the local link given by the message that ran in the last step. Yours will probably be ```localhost:3000```.
* Now, you can edit the code and push it to a fork of the website.
* Once done, open a pull request, and I will review your code and merge it!
