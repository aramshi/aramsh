[![CodeQL](https://github.com/aramshiva/website/actions/workflows/github-code-scanning/codeql/badge.svg)](https://github.com/aramshiva/website/actions/workflows/github-code-scanning/codeql)

Welcome to my website! This is currently being remaked and the preview is visible on [dev.aram.sh](https:/dev.aram.sh).

---

This site is using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as the framework (built off of [React](https://react.dev/)). I also use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for the file format as the replacement of JavaScript. [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for CSS, and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting. It is being deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com), as it is super easy to deploy serverless.
